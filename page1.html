Effects of foot orthoses on the biomechanics of the lower extremities in adults with and without musculoskeletal disorders during functional tasks: A systematic review
Clinical Biomechanics9 April 2022...
Gabriel MoisanKelly RobbVirginie Blanchette
View PDFAbstractExtractsFiguresExport
Background
Foot orthoses are among the most commonly used external supports to treat musculoskeletal disorders. It remains unclear how they change the biomechanics of the lower extremities during functional tasks. This systematic review aimed to determine the effects of foot orthoses on primary outcomes (i.e., kinematics, kinetics and electromyography of the lower extremities) in adults with and without musculoskeletal disorders during functional tasks.

Methods
A literature search was conducted for articles published from inception to June 2021 in Medline, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane libraries and PEDro electronic databases. Two investigators independently assessed the titles and abstracts of retrieved articles based on the inclusion criteria. Of the 5578 citations, 24 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis as they reported the effects of foot orthoses on the primary outcomes. Risk of bias of included studies was determined using the modified Downs and Black Quality Index.

Findings
During low impact tasks, foot orthoses decrease ankle inversion and increase midfoot plantar forces and pressure. During higher impact tasks, foot orthoses had little effects on electromyography and kinematics of the lower extremities but decreased ankle inversion moments.

Interpretation
Even though the effects of foot orthoses on the biomechanics of the lower extremities seem task-dependent, foot orthoses mainly affected the biomechanics of the distal segments during most tasks. However, few studies determined their effects on the biomechanics of the foot. It remains unclear to what extent foot orthoses features induce different biomechanical effects and if foot orthoses effects change for different populations.

The effects of foot orthoses and sensory facilitation on lower limb electromyography: A scoping review
The Foot6 January 2022...
Kelly A. RobbErika E. HoweStephen D. Perry
View PDFAbstractExtractsFiguresExport
Foot orthoses (FO) are used as a treatment for biomechanical abnormalities, overuse injuries, and neuropathologies, but study of their mechanism remains inconclusive. The neuromotor paradigm has proposed that FOs may manipulate sensory input from foot sole skin to reduce muscle activity for movement optimization. This review argues that a FO likely alters the incoming mechanical stimuli transmitted via cutaneous mechanoreceptors and nociceptors as the foot sole interfaces with the surface of the orthotic. Thus, all FOs with or without intentional sensory facilitation, likely changes sensory information from foot sole cutaneous afferents. Additionally, in light of understanding and applying knowledge pertaining to the cutaneous reflex loop circuitry, FO’s increasing sensory input to the motorneuron pool can change EMG to either reflex sign (increase or decrease). The purpose of this scoping review was to synthesize FO and sensory augmentation literature and summarize how FO designs can capitalize on foot sole skin to modulate lower limb electromyography (EMG). Six database searches resulted in 30 FO studies and 22 sensory studies that included EMG as an outcome measure. Results revealed task and phase specific responses with some consistencies in EMG outcomes between testing modalities, however many inconsistencies remain. Electrical stimulation reflex research provides support for a likely sensory-to-motor factor contributing to muscle activity modulation when wearing FOs. The discussion divides trends in FO treatment modalities by desired increase or decrease in each compartment musculature. The results of this review provides a benchmark for future academics and clinicians to advance literature in support of a revised neuromotor paradigm while highlighting the importance of foot sole skin in FO design.

Progress of additive manufacturing in fabrication of foot orthoses for diabetic patients: A review
Annals of 3D Printed MedicineOctober 2022...
Komal ChhikaraGurpreet SinghArnab Chanda
View PDFAbstractExtractsFiguresExport
The diabetic prevalent population is increasing day by day, which further increases the cases of diabetic ulceration, loss of sensation in the plantar region of the foot, and amputations in severe patients. These complications can be managed up to some extent by using modified shoes, offloading orthosis, etc. In recent advances, the use of additive manufacturing (i.e., 3D printing) to fabricate orthosis for diabetic patients is pioneering. The method of 3D printing of the foot orthosis for the diabetic foot management can be used along with the traditional methods. This review article will provide extensive literature on the pathophysiology of diabetes, the related complications and management techniques, and the use of additive manufacturing in the orthosis fabrication methods and its progress.

Identifying Instruments to Assess Care Quality for Individuals With Custom Ankle Foot Orthoses: A Scoping Review
Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation10 August 2020...
Stefania FatoneSara JerousekAllen W. Heinemann
View PDFAbstractExtractsFiguresExport
Objectives
We conducted 2 complementary scoping reviews to identify instruments that assess the experience and outcomes of custom ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) care in individuals with neurologic and traumatic conditions and to determine to what extent they might be psychometrically sound for AFO users. A stakeholder advisory committee considered to what extent the identified and psychometrically sound instruments might be feasible for use in developing quality measures for custom AFO users.

Data Sources
Both scoping reviews were conducted using PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, and Cochrane Systematic Reviews. The following were used for the first scoping review only: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database.

Study Selection
The initial scoping review yielded 79 articles with 82 instruments, 16 of which were used in 4 or more studies. The second scoping review yielded 57 articles reporting psychometric properties.

Data Extraction
Psychometric properties for populations who use AFOs were summarized for 15 of the 16 instruments. The advisory committee eliminated 2 insrtruments, noted overlap between 4 instruments in terms of the constructs measured, and suggested 6 potential contemporary substitutes.

Data Synthesis
Most instruments assessed activity (specifically mobility) and pertained to the National Quality Forum domain of “Health-Related Quality of Life.” The 10-meter walk test, 6-minute walk test, Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go, and Rivermead Mobility Index were reported to have adequate reliability and validity, and were considered feasible for administration in a clinical setting.

Conclusions
Complementary scoping reviews demonstrated that some instruments with reasonable psychometric properties are available that are feasible to use in developing quality measures for custom AFO care. However, experience of care instruments suitable for this population were not identified but are needed for a comprehensive evaluation of care quality for AFO users.

The effects of orthotics device on the balance control in multiple sclerosis patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis
Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders5 July 2022...
Maryam AshkarReza RazeghinezhadMasumeh Bagherzadeh Cham
View PDFAbstractExtractsFiguresExport
Background
Multiple sclerosis refers to a progressive autoimmune inflammatory disease in the central nervous system usually accompanied by balance disorder. Our systematic review aimed to investigate the effects of orthotic devices on balance control of multiple sclerosis patients.

Methods
The search procedure was according to the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) strategy. We looked into PubMed, Embase, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Scopus databases and included all studies published since 1980. Two researchers did the searches separately and evaluated the selected papers’ quality based on the physiotherapy evidence database (PEDro) scale and Cochrane risk of bias tool. We did a meta-analysis to evaluate the interventions’ effects on the balance factors.

Results
We found nine studies, of which seven studies with 162 participants were included in our meta-analysis. Four studies investigated the effect of foot orthoses, one evaluated the effect of shoe modifications and four evaluated the effect of ankle foot orthoses. There was no significant immediate difference between the insole and control groups in center of pressure velocity change, C7 displacement, in both open and closed eyes conditions. Also, there was no significant immediate difference between ankle foot orthosis’ intervention and control groups in center of pressure velocity and displacement changes in antero-posterior and medio-lateral directions, in both open and closed eyes conditions. We could not do a meta-analysis for shoe modification.

Conclusion
Few studies have assessed the effects of orthoses on balance control in multiple sclerosis patients. Studies on ankle foot and foot orthoses show inconsistent results. According to our meta-analysis, orthotic interventions do not seem to improve the balance of people with multiple sclerosis.

The application of Three-dimensional printing on foot fractures and deformities: A mini-review
Annals of 3D Printed Medicine14 January 2022...
Raj AgarwalShriya MalhotraVivek Jain
View PDFAbstractExtractsFiguresExport
Foot fractures have always been a great concern due to their complex anatomical structure. Medical practitioners face difficulties while operating complex anatomical structures through conventional treatment, and revision surgeries may occur in multi-fractured complex cases. The surgeon requires understanding the complex geometry of the foot. The Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology is rapidly used in the biomedical domain due to its advantages like freedom to design, complex structure fabrication, cost-effectiveness and ease of use. 3D printing is used in the biomedical field for various applications like the fabrication of hydrogels, scaffolds, vascularized soft tissues and bone implants. The role of 3D printing in biomedical is becoming vital in drug formulation, surgical planning, implants prostheses-orthoses, tissue engineering, anatomical model and organ printing. Therefore, this mini-review presents the recent advancement in 3D printing technology for foot and ankle fractures with their advantages like surgical planning, intraoperative directions, customized prostheses and orthoses. This mini-review paper is helpful for medical surgeons, researchers, and design engineers to understand the potential of 3D printing technology and its usage in the biomedical domain.

Human foot has outdistanced a long way from climbing to trees to walking all day long, within a relatively short period. Today, we are suffering from a number of aching foot problems and deformities as compromises to transition from quadripedalism to bipedalism, which is perhaps the sole derivative of the modern human being. In today’s modern environment, the choice between being chic or healthy is a difficult decision to make, consequently our feet ache. To cope with such evolutionary mismatches we only need to adopt our ancestors’ receipt: wearing minimal shoes, walking and squatting as much as we can.

Summary
Objective
To summarise the available evidence relating to the diagnosis, epidemiology, burden, outcome assessment and treatment of foot and ankle osteoarthritis (OA) and to develop an agenda to guide future research.

Method
Members of the International Foot and Ankle Osteoarthritis Consortium compiled a narrative summary of the literature which formed the basis of an interactive discussion at the Osteoarthritis Research Society International World Congress in 2021, during which a list of 24 research agenda items were generated. Following the meeting, delegates were asked to rank the research agenda items on a 0 to 100 visual analogue rating scale (0 = not at all important to 100 = extremely important). Items scoring a mean of 70 or above were selected for inclusion.

Results
Of the 45 delegates who attended the meeting, 31 contributed to the agenda item scoring. Nineteen research agenda items met the required threshold: three related to diagnosis, four to epidemiology, four to burden, three to outcome assessment and five to treatment.

Conclusions
Key knowledge gaps related to foot and ankle OA were identified, and a comprehensive agenda to guide future research planning was developed. Implementation of this agenda will assist in improving the understanding and clinical management of this common and disabling, yet relatively overlooked condition.

Neuro-Orthopedic Surgery for Equinovarus Foot Deformity in Adults: A Narrative Review
The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery29 November 2021...
Etienne AllartNadine Sturbois-NachefFrançois Genêt
View PDFAbstractExtractsFiguresExport
Neuro-orthopedic surgery is an alternative to the conservative treatment of spastic equinovarus foot (SEF) in adults. The objective of the present narrative review was to summarize current practice with regard to patient assessment, the choice of treatment, the various neuro-orthopedic procedures, and the latter's outcomes. We searched literature databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane) for original articles or opinion papers on surgical treatment of spastic equinovarus foot in adults. Neuro-orthopedic approaches require a careful analysis of the patient's and/or his/her caregiver needs and thus relevant treatment goals. Surgical planning requires detailed knowledge of impairments involved in the spastic equinovarus foot deformity based on a careful clinical examination and additional information from diagnostic nerve blocks and/or a quantitative gait analysis. Procedures mainly target nerves (neurotomy) and tendons (lengthening, transfer, tenotomy). These procedures reduce impairments (spasticity, range of motion, and foot position), improve gait and walking function, but their impact on participation and personalized treatment goals remains to be demonstrated. Neuro-orthopedic surgery is an effective treatment option for spastic equinovarus foot in adults. However, practice is still very heterogeneous and there is no consensus on the medical strategies to be applied before, during and after surgery (particularly the type of anesthesia, the need for immobilization, rehabilitation procedures).

Abstract
Abstract
Skeletal variations of the foot include bipartitions. Bipartition of the talus, navicular, medial cuneiform, hallucal sesamoids, and accessory bones have been reported. Apart from the hallucal sesamoids, bipartite bones of the foot are rarely found. When identified, they can range from asymptomatic incidental findings to significant sources of pain. Relatively sparse information is available about most of these entities; limited to case series and case reports. The goals of this review are to discuss clinical and radiographic presentation, review the existing literature about these entities, focusing on treatments and their outcomes.

Kirstyn JamesAriela R. OrkabyAndrea Wershof Schwartz
View PDFAbstractExtractsExport
The foot changes with age. Foot disorders in older adults are associated with falls, lower limb ulcers, and pain. Physical examination of the feet as part of the routine assessment of older adults is imperative to detect foot problems. Foot pain and pathologies are common in older adults. Regular foot care is important to prevent these issues. However, some older adults may find it difficult to complete foot care, including cutting toenails. Regular foot examination can detect common foot problems, functional decline, and is recommended for preventing falls. We describe a technique for performing a focused examination of the feet for older adults. This review addresses current podiatric issues in older patient populations and describes a method for foot examination to address the needs of older adults that can be incorporated into patient assessments in any clinical setting.

View PDFAbstractExtractsFiguresExport
Objective
To report on preoperative outcomes that guide the choice of surgical techniques to correct equinovarus foot in adults with brain injury.

Methods
Four databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, PEDro) were searched according to the PRISMA guidelines. Studies were included regardless of their level of proof, with no limitation on date of publication, and their quality was assessed with the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies score.

Results
We analysed 61 studies (n = 2,293 participants); 523 participants underwent neurotomy, 437 calf musculotendinous lengthening, and 888 tibialis anterior transfer or alternative anterior transfers with the flexor digitorum/hallucis longus (n = 249), the extensor hallucis longus (n = 102), the tibialis posterior (n = 41) and the peroneus longus (n = 41). Two studies were dedicated to osteoarticular surgeries (n = 12 participants). Ankle dorsiflexors motricity was assessed before 70% of neurotomies as compared with 29% before isolated calf lengthening studies, their strength being at least 3/5 in 33% and 50% of the studies concerned, respectively. Passive ankle dorsiflexion was assessed before surgery in 87% of neurotomy studies, with 62% of studies investigating non-retracted spastic equinovarus foot. Before anterior tendon transfer with the tibialis anterior or another muscle, passive ankle dorsiflexion was reported in only 20% and 46% of studies, respectively, and dynamic tibialis anterior activation during gait in 46% and 56%. Although voluntary recruitment of the tibialis anterior produced a better functional result, the presence/correction of varus justified its transfer in 60% of studies as compared with 30% in other transfers, which were justified by hyperactivity or voluntary recruitment of transferred muscle.

Conclusions
This review highlights the poor level of preoperative assessment and the absence of formal criteria to indicate the different surgical approaches in the management of equinovarus foot. It reinforces the interest of a systematic standardized preoperative assessment such as selective motor block and dynamic electromyography to choose the most suitable surgical procedure.

The optimal treatment strategy for the presentation of multiple Morton's neuromas in adjacent intermetatarsal spaces of the same foot is yet to be determined. We aimed to summarize and assess the efficacy of current treatment strategies. A systematic review, adhering to PRIMSA guidelines was performed. A computer base search was completed in PubMed, Embase, Cinahl, ISI Web of Science, Scopus and Emcare, for articles reporting the treatment of multiple neuromas in the same foot. The review is registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42020213631). A total of 253 articles were identified, with 7 articles being included in the review. The most common treatment strategy reported was simultaneous neuroma excision using a single incision, while 2 studies each describe simultaneous excision with 2 separate incisions and delayed excision respectively. There is no strong evidence favoring use of delayed excision or multiple incisions. Further high-quality research is required to make more definitive conclusions and future research should investigate other strategies such as non-operative treatment.

To establish the comparative effects of conservative interventions on modifying foot progression angle (FPA) in children and adults with orthopaedic and neurological disease was the main aim of the literature review. Pubmed, Embase, Cinahl, and Web of Science were systematically searched for studies evaluating the effects of conservative interventions on correcting the FPA. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020143512). Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion and quality. Studies that assessed conservative interventions that could have affected the FPA and objectively measured the FPA were included. Within group Mean Differences (MD) and Standardized Mean Differences (SMDs) of the interventions were calculated for the change in FPA and gait performance (walking speed, stride/step length) and clinical condition (pain). Intervention effects on FPA were synthesized via meta-analysis or qualitatively. 41 studies were identified. For patients with knee osteoarthritis gait training interventions (MD = 6.69° and MD = 16.06°) were significantly more effective than mechanical interventions (MD = 0.44°) in modifying the FPA towards in-toeing (p < 0.00001). Increasing or decreasing the FPA significantly improved pain in patients with medial knee OA. Results were inconclusive for the effectiveness of gait training and mechanical devices in patients with neurological diseases. Gait feedback training is more effective than external devices to produce lasting improvements in FPA, reduce pain, and maintain gait performance in patients with medial knee OA. However, in neurological patients, the effects of external devices on improvements in FPA depends on the interaction between patient-specific impairments and the technical properties of the external device.

View PDFAbstractExtractsFiguresExport
Diabetic foot disease, or ulceration, is prevalent and is associated with high rates of lower limb amputation and mortality. Its underlying aetiology is complex and multifactorial. However, neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease represent two important precipitating risk factors. Regular, comprehensive foot examinations are important in the prevention of ulceration and cardiovascular complications as they provide an opportunity to assess risk, modify risk factors and deliver patient education. Charcot neuropathic osteoarthropathy is commonly misdiagnosed and should always be suspected in an individual with diabetes presenting with a hot and swollen foot. Diabetic foot ulcers are challenging to manage. The key to optimizing outcomes includes early diagnosis with referral for coordinated multidisciplinary care where prompt treatment of infection and peripheral arterial disease, as well as appropriate wound care and offloading can be initiated and monitored.

Mohammad KarimiMahsa KavyaniRazieh Tahmasebi
View PDFAbstractExtractsFiguresExport
There are various treatment approaches for the subjects with metatarsus adductus, including nonsurgical and surgical treatment. Nonsurgical treatments such as serial casting, modified shoes (Bebax shoe, Ipos antiadductus shoe) and orthoses (Wheaton brace, counter rotation system splint, Denis Brown bar, and Fillauer bar) are widely used in this regard. The main question posted here is which orthoses are more effective in correcting metatarsus adductus. Therefore, the aim of this review was to determine the efficiency of various nonsurgical treatments used for metatarsus adductus. MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, Cochrane Data base of systematic review (CDSR), Scopus and ISI Web of knowledge (from 1960 to 2021) were searched by predefined search strategies to screen eligible randomized controlled studies meeting established criteria. The quality of the studies was assessed based on Down and Black tool. 200 studies on this topic were reviewed and finally 11 studies which met the inclusion criteria were selected for final analysis. These studies evaluated the efficiency of nonsurgical treatment options on foot angle and deformity correction in the subjects with metatarsus adductus. Quality of the papers based on Downs and Black tool varied between 13 and 23. Some treatments such as Wheaton brace, rigid strap, exercise (manipulation), reverse last shoe and plaster cast are used for these subjects. Although good correction can be achieved with use of these treatment methods, some of them have complications which should be considered in this regard. It seems that Wheaton brace and Bebax shoe have fewer complications compared to other methods.

Adopting additive manufacturing as a cleaner fabrication framework for topologically optimized orthotic devices: Implications over sustainable rehabilitation
Cleaner Engineering and Technology8 September 2022...
Ashwani KumarDeepak Chhabra
View PDFAbstractGraphical AbstractExtractsFiguresExport
The theme of additive manufacturing technology (AMT) is trending among all production sectors, whether it is a mass-production industry or concerned with customized parts fabrication. It provides a proportionally balanced framework to deal with a beneficiary's needs with a stunning overall sustainable performance. This paper describes the potential benefits of adopting the AMT for topologically customized orthotic fabrication and suggests the medical sector sustainability perspectives. Orthotic devices are used to support the functionality of a body part raised due to any deficiency or deformity and provide comfortable healing abetment to the limb by supportive shock reduction, motion assistance, or restriction with customized rehabilitation. This study comprises a detailed review of recent additive manufacturing (AM) innovations in advanced orthotics and the rehabilitation perspective that demands topology optimization (TO) for customized splint fabrication. A systematic multidisciplinary AM framework has also been proposed to promote AMT as a streamlined cleaner fabrication approach in orthotics and healthcare, integrating efficient scanning & printing with optimization result interpretation network and finite element analysis (FEA) based continuously rectifying orthotic design database feeding from biomechanical performance evaluations. The evidential facts concluded that the ability to fabricate any complex geometry with ease of doing is the primary sustainable attribute for adopting the AMT to instantly fabricate patient-specific orthoses/splints/braces that are lightweight, ventilated, hygienic, appealing, strengthened, biocompatible and functionally comfortable. The strategic involvement of the proposed AM framework in the healthcare industry will promote mass customization of topologically optimized orthotic devices and enhance the process and product performance sustainability at the industrial, environmental, financial, resourcial and end-user level.

In the foot and ankle, it most commonly presents as a sudden onset of a painful fixed ankle/hindfoot deformity in a female patient with a history of trivial trauma or surgery. The “fixed deformity” found on clinical examination is usually correctable under general anesthesia. Less commonly, it can present in the toes or may present as paroxysmal muscle movements rather than a fixed deformity. CRPS may occur concurrently with the dystonia.

Failure to consider the diagnosis leads to a long delay in appropriate diagnosis, patient distress and unnecessary or even harmful surgery. A better approach to this clinical syndrome is to define it as fixed abnormal posturing that is most commonly psychogenic. Early referral to a movement disorder clinic is recommended. The prognosis is generally poor as less than a quarter of patients report subjective long-term improvement even when managed in a movement disorder clinic. Foot and ankle surgeons should, whenever possible, avoid operating on patients with functional dystonia in order to avoid symptomatic deterioration.

Foot and ankle biomechanics during walking in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies
Gait & Posture26 June 2021...
Fateme PolHamzeh BaharloueiSaeed Forghany
View PDFAbstractExtractsFiguresExport
Background
The foot and ankle complex undergoes significant structural and functional changes with advancing age.

Research question
The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize and critique the research literature pertaining to foot and ankle biomechanics while walking in young and older adults.

Methods
Electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Embase) were searched from inception to April 2019 for cross-sectional studies which compared kinematics, kinetics and plantar pressure differences between young and older adults. Screening and data extraction were performed by two independent assessors, with disagreements resolved by consensus.

Results
A total of 39 articles underwent full-text screening, and 19 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included. Meta-analysis showed that older adults had less ankle joint plantar flexion (5 studies; weighted mean difference [WMD]: −5.15; 95 %CI: −6.47 to −3.83; P < 0.001) and less ankle joint power generation (6 studies; standardized mean difference [SMD]: −0.62; 95 %CI: −0.82 to −0.41; P < 0.001) during propulsion compared to young adults. These differences persisted in subgroup analyses comparing different walking speeds. Plantar pressure findings were highly variable due to differences in data collection protocols and meta-analysis was not possible.

Significance
Older adults have unique foot and ankle kinematics and kinetics during walking characterized by reduced ankle joint plantarflexion and power generation during propulsion.

The management of foot and ankle ganglia: A scoping review
The Foot24 December 2021...
Zaki ArshadAdil M. IqbalManeesh Bhatia
View PDFAbstractExtractsFiguresExport
Purpose
A ganglion cyst is a benign soft tissue swelling filled with hyaluronic acid and other mucopolysaccharides. Whilst they most commonly present in the wrist region, their occurrence in the foot and ankle is not rare. This scoping review aims to systematically map and summarise current evidence regarding the management of ganglia of the foot and ankle, whilst identifying areas for further research.

Methods
This scoping review follows the frameworks of Arksey and O’Malley, Levac and Peters. A comprehensive search strategy was used to identify relevant articles, before a two-stage screening process was performed independently by two reviewers.

Results
A total of 2286 unique articles were identified, of which 12 were included in the review. A variety of conservative and surgical treatment strategies are reported, showing good outcomes. An overall pooled recurrence rate of 29.5% was seen across 8 studies. Aspiration alone showed the highest recurrence rate (78.1%), followed by aspiration and steroid injection (62%), steroid injection alone (37.5%) and surgical excision (17.6%). The pooled complication rate across six studies was 21/261 (8.0%), with the most common complication being paraesthesia, reported in 14/261 (5.4%) patients.

Conclusions
There is a lack of high-quality research currently regarding the treatment of foot and ankle ganglia. Limited evidence suggests that there could potentially be associations between time to treatment, ganglion location and extent of surgical resection and recurrence rate. However, further research is required before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.

Management of the diabetic foot
Seminars in Vascular Surgery12 April 2022...
Tiffany R. BellomoSujin LeeSara Rose-Sauld
View PDFAbstractExtractsFiguresExport
The increasing prevalence of diabatic foot ulcers (DFUs) is not only costly, but carries a large mortality burden. In this article, we discuss important traditional concepts in the management of DFUs and elaborate on how new technologies have expanded our ability to treat DFUs effectively. New supplies and wound care products have been developed to target the following traditional areas of focus: tissue, infection/inflammation, moisture, and edge. Offloading strategies have grown from standard orthotics or insoles to total contact casting and three-dimensional–printed orthotics to produce the optimum material stiffness for each patient. The concepts of pressure and temperature monitoring have led to the development of multiple devices that transmit continuous monitoring in real time, giving a dynamic picture of plantar stress and training patients in new walking strategies for self-offloading. Surgical approaches have also evolved from the classic surgical debridement and correcting deformities that cause friction to creation of acellular and bio-printed cellular skin substitutes that can be used for grafting. Surveillance and long-term follow-up with a multidisciplinary team have also changed in the face of smartphones and watches that allow patients to monitor themselves in real time with daily prompts and reminders to shape desired behaviors in between clinic visits. Modern technology is changing management of DFUs by expanding on traditional concepts and improving standard therapies.

Kaissar YammineJoeffroy OtayekChahine ASSI
View PDFAbstractExtractsFiguresExport
Background
Limb preserving surgery for the treatment of diabetic foot complications (DFC) has been shown to yield excellent results and better outcomes when compared to non-surgical standard of care. The quality of the articles reporting the results of limb preserving surgery in treating DFC is quite low. The aim of this study was to evaluate the published systematic reviews and meta-analyses that looked at the efficacy of limb preserving surgery in treating DFC.

Methods
PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched for all systematic reviews and meta-analyses on limb preserving surgery in DFC. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool for systematic reviews was used to appraise studies’ quality.

Results
22 systematic reviews and meta-analyses with a total of 10,559 patients met the inclusion criteria. Five reviews reported on surgical treatment of diabetic Charcot, 5 reviews on bony procedures and 12 reviews on soft tissue procedures for treating DFU. The results of each review were reported. The vast majority of the studies were of Level IV of evidence. The mean JBI score was 9.82.

Conclusions
There is an underuse of the available limb preserving operations for the treatment of DFC despite excellent results and variety of procedures available in the literature, especially for Charcot neuroarthropathy and diabetic foot and toe ulcers.

Foot ulcers associated with external trauma among people with diabetes: An integrative review of the origin of trauma and outcomes
International Journal of Nursing Studies4 November 2020...
Ma'en Zaid Abu-QamarVivien KempLisa Whitehead
View PDFAbstractExtractsFiguresExport
Background
Foot ulcers are common among people with diabetes. These ulcers are caused by a number of factors including trauma. To date, research findings on the origin of external trauma and the outcome of foot ulcers resulting from an external trauma have not been summarised.

Objective
To examine the origin of external trauma that contribute to the development of foot ulcers among people with diabetes and the outcome of such ulcers.

Design
An integrative review.

Settings
Hospital/community.

Participants
Patients with diabetes and foot ulcer.

Method
The Joanna Briggs framework was used to underpin this integrative review. Six different databases (CINAHL +, Medline, SCOPUS, Embase, ProQuest and Web of Science databases) were searched systematically to find research publications reporting traumas that contributed to foot ulcers sustained by people with diabetes. The search was limited to articles published in English. The search revealed 3193 articles that were filtered to 78 articles to be assessed at the full-text level and 45 articles were subsequently included. Quality appraisal was conducted independently by two reviewers, using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal tools. Data were extracted into a form developed for the purpose of this review. Narrative synthesis was used to manage the extracted verbatim details on the origin of external trauma contributing to foot ulcers and the outcomes.

Results
The origins of external trauma were summarised into two domains and further specified into 16 categories. The identified traumas were mainly minor and originated within the home environment. The most commonly reported origins of external trauma were puncture wounds, ill-fitting shoes and self-care practices that caused foot ulcers. Twenty-seven studies reported outcomes following the development of an ulcer. Twenty-two studies reported amputation as an outcome and mortality was reported in 10 studies. It was not clear whether these outcomes were directly related to the foot ulcer or related to other diabetes-related complications.

Conclusions
The majority of ulcers occurred in the home environment and were preventable in nature. The assessment of an individual's local context, particularly the home and actions to reduce risk is a priority. The extent of the risks related to external trauma need to be more widely communicated through clinical guidelines and training opportunities for frontline staff.

Tweetable abstract
The main origins of external foot trauma among people with diabetes were puncture wounds, ill-fitting footwear and self-care practices.

Patient Compliance With Wearing Lower Limb Assistive Devices: A Scoping Review
Journal of Manipulative and Physiological TherapeuticsFebruary 2022...
Ayisha Z. BashirDanae M. DinkelSara A. Myers
View PDFAbstractExtractsFiguresExport
Objective
The aim of this scoping review was to identify information on compliance with wearing orthoses and other supportive devices, to discuss the barriers to adherence, and to suggest strategies for improvement based on these findings.

Methods
Online databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched for articles about patients’ compliance with regard to lower limb assistive devices. In addition, a methodological quality control process was conducted. Studies were included if in the English language and related to compliance and adherence to the lower limb assistive device. Exclusion was based on first reading the abstract and then the full manuscript confirming content was not related to orthotic devices and compliance.

Results
Twelve studies were included. The data revealed between 6% and 80% of patients were not using a prescribed device. Barriers to the use of the orthotic device included medical, functional, device properties and lack of proper fit. Strategies for improved compliance included better communication between patient and clinician, patient education, and improved comfort and device esthetics.

Conclusions
Individualized orthotic adjustments, rehabilitation, and patient education were promising for increasing adherence. Despite positive aspects of improvements in gait, balance in elderly, and a sense of security produced by using assistive devices, compliance remains less than ideal due to barriers. As compliance in recent studies has not improved, continued work in this area is essential to realize the benefits of technological advances in orthotic and assistive devices.

Amyoplasia and distal arthrogryposis
Orthopaedics & Traumatology: Surgery & Research13 December 2020...
Jacques GriffetKlaus DieterichEmeline Bourgeois
View PDFAbstractExtractsFiguresExport
Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) consists of congenital joint contractures that affect at least two joints. There are two types: in the first, arthrogryposis is an additional sign in the context of various pathologies (neuromuscular diseases); in the second, it is the main and constant symptom. In the first type, the progression of the causal underlying disease must be considered. In the second type, there are two specific forms: Amyoplasia corresponds to a significant congenital absence of muscles (epigenetic disease or vascular origin) while distal arthrogryposis has a genetic component and is transmissible. The orthopedic surgeon's purpose, which is usually to enhance movement, is not appropriate for an arthrogryposis patient. One must keep in mind that without muscle, movement is impossible. The goal differs between the upper and lower limbs: for the upper limb, it is to allow grasping, and, if possible, to bring the hand to the mouth; for the lower limb, it is to ensure ambulation with plantigrade support, and the knees extended, which is the only stable position possible with little to no muscles. The rehabilitation, orthoses and/or surgical techniques are chosen to achieve this singular aim. While it may appear modest, it is crucial for patients. The goal is to achieve useful mobility, not maximum mobility. This multidisciplinary treatment, which evolves over time, must be explained to the family to get its adherence.
